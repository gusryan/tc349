There must be a name for this type of design, as we’ve seen it a few times over in recent weeks…one where content is stacked onto the page without the benefit of the Rule of Thirds, a harmonious palette selection off the color wheel or any discernible design theory (at least those my limited education has exposed me to. :)  Assuming the top and bottom sections represent header and footer, Happy Cog does make effective use of padding and margin in this body of their page. This allows for the inclusion of negative space to help clear space in the overloaded index page. 

The site takes the all-in-one-scroll design approach to a new level however, as all the site content appears to reside on the index page. Surely there are Easter eggs that live in the nooks and crannies of Happy Cog, but it’s tough to prove without a site map or a wealth of free time to spend exhausting links (though I have no doubt a site mapper tool/site already exists somewhere!). 

Happy Cog also uses a horizontal navigation banner -makes me wonder if they’ve been following along with your lessons :)- that floats until it locks atop the page if the user scrolls downward. This is a nifty little feature that remains a positive, despite the stomach-flipping speed-scroll that happens when the visitor selects a “link” to visit. Again, the options here all point to content that exists on the index page, so the effect is a sort of constant scrolling as links are clicked. It’s annoying at best and carries a potential vertigo-inducing quality on the other end of the spectrum. For a company that, “painstakingly craft(s) digital experience(s),” this is a major swing and miss in my book. But if you’re looking for the latest bells and whistles, including those that do not appeal to all masses, Happy Cog looks like a keen place to start.
