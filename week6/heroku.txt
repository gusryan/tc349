Maybe we’re missing something here Jeff, because heroku.com seems to fall in line with those sites that openly violate the agreed upon rules of design theory. Heroku.com = Rule of Infinite Thirds perhaps? I get the sense that website design “theory” is driven by the user and each new manifestation causes what the old clichérs would call a paradigm shift. The difference now seems to be the speed at which this happens. Nevertheless, heroku.com uses a header atop the home page and contrast within the next section. Similarly, there’s a footer at the bottom containing a wealth of links. 

Heroku.com’s design makes nice use of mouse over techniques and truly vibrant contrast when hovering. When in this particular state, the hovered section lights up the page with content describing their service offerings. According to those same clichérs, “a couple of them really pop.” In general, their offerings are geared toward data base and storage arrays and meeting a variety of other digital needs in their customer base. Heroku gives snappy names to their different digital combinations, attaching names like Kappa and Zilla, complete with mini mascots, to their cache offerings. Some would call it lipstick on a pig, while other might call heroku the cheapest Baku website out there. I’m not sure, but parts of the site are really impressive. I do wonder why they actually created such contrast (is that even right? It seems like an understatement) for Postgres and Java mouse overs, but not as much for Apps. Either way, they’re all cased in a gallery display. Good stuff across the board here in terms of content. So one theory proved to be true with heroku: content > design.
