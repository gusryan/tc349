A site I routinely access from my mobile device is soccerway.com. Truth be told, I am not much of a “grass fairy,” but I do play ESPN streak for the Cash, which often poses predictive results of soccer matches as a part of their props. Soccerway is a great site for all things, well…soccer, but it uses a static, non-responsive design. This technique renders the page on your mobile as if your device is a wide-screen monitor. In other words, the width of the page is equivalent to the width of your mobile device…effectively rendering (read: scrunching) an 800+ pixel wide webpage onto a 320 pixel wide device. This technique maintains the size ratios, so the images and content are neat and tidily arranged. But it also renders “everything” on the 320 pixel wide screen, which causes the tidy to become tiny. No thanks.

The experience is not a bad one, though it does require fairly keen eyesight to see the tiny details of the site. As an example the site poses matchup-related data for each and every soccer/futbol match around the globe. Given this expansive scope, the match list can grow to be fairly long. This length, coupled with the absence of effective media queries, can make it challenging to select the preferred match from the list. In fact, in order to follow any link on soccerway from a mobile device, the easiest path is to expand the screen size so as not to fat finger the selection only to wind up reviewing match details for some random farm-league game instead of the detail of the day’s Premier League matches. Oh the difference a few meta tags and css calls can make. Soccerway could benefit from a few of these indeed.
