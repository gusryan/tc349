Etsy is primarily an online shoping outlet of sorts that offers products ranging from iPhone accessories 
to ceramic skulls. The site has an eclectic selection of gear, which bring sense to a name like Etsy.
What makes Etsy unique is not their approach to online selling, which allows for visitors to create 
accounts at the site and sell their wares through the Etsy interface. No, what makes Etsy unique is its 
"Community" section, which allows users to connect in groups with others that share similar interests. To 
that end, Etsy offers users the opportunity to create Teams, attend Events, and even participate in 
"Online Labs" that focus on topics of mutual interest.

Relative to commerce, Etsy focuses on gear that falls into three broad categories: Vintage (20+ yrs old), 
homemade and supplies. These categories seek to limit the amount of "junk" for sale on the same, but they 
certainly don't limit the range of exotics its patrons offer through Etsy. As for the design, it's a light 
and clean feel with easy to use, if not boring, navigation. The focus is on the available gear, and the site 
respects that approach through its design. In all, if you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary, 
or simply want to connect with others who may share your interests, Etsy is probably worth a look.
