I've used several webdev environments over the years, though it has been awhile since
I've lived inside an html editor day to day. Way back when, my favorite enviro was HomeSite, 
which, I believe, was bought and eventually decomm'd by Adobe. Since it's been awhile and since 
my favorite product no longer seems to be available (and given DW came with my recent purchase), 
I am moving to adopt Adobe Dreamweaver as my new dev environment.

While it's not exactly scientific, I have arrived at this choice based on my history 
in this field and experience with many editors. In truth, I find notepad to be the easiest 
editor of an existing file for small edits and minor tweaks. Of course, if I'm creating a 
file or need in-depth coding, an editor is preferred and Dreamweaver is my choice at this 
stage of the game. I reserve the right to change my mind at a later date, of course. :)
