ok, I'm not seeing where it restricts my critique choices...so I'll jump around a bit if you 
don't mind...

jasonsantamaria.com has a crisp feel and the use of negative space gives is a clean look. I 
really like how it's a blog, but you keep asking yourself if it's really a blog. I also find 
much of the content to be interesting as well. But above all, I look the walk down historical 
alley, dating all the way back to his Flash-based v1. What a piece of....core ciriculum at MSU.

In general, I also like the concept of what he's trying to do...and doing in the process. I 
rarely view the internet as art, but visual appeal happens naturally and is often overlooked 
for the sake of advertising and clutter. More can be too much in my book, and this website 
provides a good amount of information and easy to navigate links. But I get the sense that 
innovation and creativity with respect to web spaces achitectures are the norm for Mr. Santa Maria.
