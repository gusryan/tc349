MSU.edu has several strengths and a seemingly equal amount of weaknesses, in my opinion. 
The site is packed with content and links, which works both for and against the site. 
Specifically, MSU.edu contains a section on the popular Spartan Story/Sage campaign, a 
section of the page that shares the latest Tweets related to MSU and several other sections 
that reveal headlines and act as links to content the site possesses. Good stuff for the 
information starved visitor.

While there are multiple schools of thought here, this site seems to come from the "more is more" 
camp of design. In my estimation, more is too much for MSU.edu. The site employs the 
ever-popular "Rule of Fourths" from top to bottom...wait, you've never heard of the Rule of Fourths? 
Me neither. Chalk up another point for the "too much" category. Interestingly, or ironically 
if you're into that sort of thing, the site's creators weren't happy with packing all this content 
into a single homepage. So in order to pack in EVEN more, they've deployed flash in the center of 
the page in order to scroll through photos...which link to even more content. I'm tired already.

In all, I'm not a big fan of MSU.edu. There's too much happening on the front page and I feel 
like I need have A.D.D. to consume it all. My eyes are drawn (distracted) in multiple directions 
before I can take in any given section, and the flashing bit are incredibly distracting. Of course, 
I understand, too, that I am likely not the target audience, nor possess the typical student profile. 
But even with that in mind, I say that MSU.edu is too busy, there's almost no negative space to rest 
one's eyes, and the it's difficult to review the volumes of content exposed by the front page due to 
the Flashy bits that work to distract the visitor.
