<p>This website was setup to lend some detail to the fitness goals I took on this summer. These goals were two-fold. First, run a modest 500 miles over the course of the year. The second goal, which was established only after running in the Bayshore race in May, was a bit more aggressive: run a half marathon a month from May until October. </P>
<p>
Admittedly, I failed at the second goal. But this was largely due to the limited number of Half Marathons available in Michigan in the sweltering months of July and August. Upon realizing that it was going to be tough to find races at the 11th hour that still had space, I opted to run races of some length as a Half Marathon alternate in the months of August and September (as opposed to running in a series of 5k races). Therefore, in August and September, I ran races of 10 and 8 miles, respectively.</p>
<p> Please click on the links above to see additional detail regarding the races I ran and a monthly view of my training efforts. Enjoy!! </p>
