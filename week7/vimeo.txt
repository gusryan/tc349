Here we go again…Vimeo is a mess, frankly. This site is all about eye-blending content on the front page in an effort to appeal to the mass of A.D.D-ers  among us. I’m no expert in the art of website design, but this approach is absolutely lost on me. With that said, I do appreciate the purpose of Vimeo, and as such, offering previews of as many videos as possible on the index page seems to make sense. But again here…more is sometimes too much.

Technically speaking, there’s a header and a footer, with a series of gallery presentations (in what seem to be both vertical and horizontal renderings) of Vimeo’s video content between these two sections. But what else lies between is the eye-catching content…and I don’t mean that in a good way. I am distracted by the content surrounding the video galleries and honestly, I’m not even sure where Vimeo is directing my gaze. What content is most important here? Where does Vimeo want me to look?? There’s so much clutter that I’m not convinced that this site is only about videos. 

Interestingly, the site map works to simplify and categorize the site’s content in a more user-friendly presentation. Of course, this page lacks the flair and drama of the clutter-bug index page, but for folks interested in getting at Vimeo’s non-video content, this might be the best (or perhaps only) way to get there. And in my getting-educated opinion, if you’re visiting Vimeo, you’ve got to really want it. Because if it’s me, I’m hacking Google and searching for my video content with the site: vimeo.com modifier. This because the front page is so wildly unappealing to me that I’d just as soon avoid Vimeo’s presentation and go right to the content (video) types I’m searching for.
