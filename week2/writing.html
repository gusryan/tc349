<center><h2>Gus Ryan Bio</h2></center>

  <p>Ryan is an Information Security professional with 15 years of experience providing Information Technology solutions to the enterprise. He studied English and Telecommunications at Michigan State University and loves all things baseball. He's passionate about baking security into one's digital life, from the way we consume and contribute to the Internet, to the notion of what kind, where we keep and store digital copies of our most sensitive data sets. He is a card carrying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional">CISSP</a> (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and a member of several social groups focused on the tenants of information security. 
</p>
<p>
Ryan happily spends much of his spare time with family. But when he's not involved in extracurricular activities of an often adolescent nature, you may find him somewhere hilly and scenic, either training for his next half marathon or golfing. You can find him on Facebook as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/gus.ryan.7">Gus Ryan</a> and on Twitter as pltgf.

<center><h2>critique of <a href="http://www.panic.com">panic.com</a></h2></center>
Panic.com has a nice feel in both look and presentation. The color palate is fresh and the site has a narrow design, suggesting optimization on portrait-oriented iOS devices. Interestingly, the site incorporates Flash, which is not compatible with Apple gadgets. But that doesn't detract from the overall experience. In all, it's cool enough to pass the first test. 
<p>
The products have merit and serve their respective purposes, as well. <a href="http://panic.com/prompt">Prompt</a> enables the user to connect to other devices over a secure SSH tunnel. Transmit looks to enable other secure transport mechanisms, which are generally preferred over the open channel. Code offers the ability to manipulate web pages from your iOS device. In two flavors. Off the top, I see four out of five apps as being useful to me personally, so I like this site's products. As an aside, Panic also offers t-shirts which harken back to 1982 with seemingly vintage gear.
